# Get the directory containing the script being executed
# From: https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128:
# It will work as long as the last component of the path used to find the script is not a symlink
# (directory links are OK). If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a
# multi-line solution:
```sh
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
```

# Some of the comments at the above link suggest that the below is better:
```sh
DIR=$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")
```

```sh
find /home/www \( -type d -name .git -prune \) -o -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/subdomainA\.example\.com/subdomainB.example.com/g'
```
