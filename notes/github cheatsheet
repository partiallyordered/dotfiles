### Link to compare view between two commits:
```
https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/compare/<lhs-commit>..<rhs-commit>
```
Example:
```
https://github.com/modusbox/mojaloop-sdk-scheme-adapter/compare/9c86bd6..614f03f
```
Note that whenever you push you'll see most of this URL is constructed for you at the end of the
output of `git push`:
```
To github.com:casablanca-project/admin-portal-web-ui-backend.git
   5c93d4d..a00b452  feature/MOWDEV-1333 -> feature/MOWDEV-1333
