Set up an ignore file for a repo outside of the .gitignore file. From https://stackoverflow.com/a/1753078

Edit the `.git/info/exclude` file as though it were a `.gitignore` file

OR

```sh
git config --global core.excludesFile=/path/to/global/gitignore/file
```

It looks like git also respects `~/.config/git/ignore` as a global ignore.
