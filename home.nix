  # TODO: write a copy tool (tentatively) called "telegraph" that can copy something from stdin in
  #       one terminal, then paste it to stdout in another, optionally using a handle for said
  #       thing (and potentially optionally keeping said thing open). It would detect whether it's
  #       receiving on stdin or not, and adapt its behaviour correspondingly.
  #
  #       Example:
  #       Terminal 1:
  #         telegraph < some.file
  #       Then, in terminal 2:
  #         telegraph > file.exists.here.now
  #
  #       Example with handle
  #       Terminal 1:
  #         telegraph nginx_config_file < nginx.conf
  #       Then, in terminal 2:
  #         telegraph nginx_config_file > nginx.conf
  #       Bonus points for autocomplete here
  #
  #       Bonus points for
  #       - streaming the file without loading it all into memory first, probably through a named
  #         fifo (in /run or similar? where do these things normally go?).
  #       - supporting directories
  #       - supporting move (not just copy)
  #       - supporting multiple files
  #         - this could potentially be achieved by having multiple fifos in a directory e.g.
  #           /run/telegraph/default/file1 /run/telegraph/default/file2 etc.
  #
  #       Notes:
  #       - telegraph should use a default named fifo, and delete it after it's finished- then it
  #         can detect if that default named fifo already exists and present an error ("another
  #         telegraph is being sent on this wire right now").
  #
  #       Options:
  #         -f, --fork     | run in the background, this allows the user to navigate elsewhere in
  #                        | the same terminal then call telegraph when they've reached their
  #                        | destination
  #         -m, --multiple | allow the input to be consumed multiple times (this might be too
  #                        | difficult to achieve cleanly, and be a niche use case anyway)

  # TODO: Editor wishlist:

  #         - Reasonably fast compile times
  #         - This is feasible in XMonad because types tell users a lot about the interface and
  #           capabilities they can leverage. Rust has a rich type system that will give the same
  #           advantages.
  #           - It's rather tricky to configure XMonad as a non-Haskell user

  # TODO: make a generalised tree select tui or gui, where the user provides a tree of options in

  #       - allow single-key mode, so that the user provides each node with a selection key
  #         - this allows fast navigation for users accustomed to a menu they use often
  #       - allow descriptions, or perhaps even unstructured metadata
  #       - allow the user to specify how much of the tree is displayed, e.g. whether the parent
  #         list and the currently selected child list should be displayed (so in this example,
  #         three levels, parents, the node level and the children)
  #       - optional title

  #         return its children
  #         - optional caching
  #       - optionally return either the node, or the path through the tree?
  #       - deep-tree search functionality, allowing fuzzy search on the whole tree at once, i.e.
  #         if a node five levels deep matches, display this node
  #       - this is fundamentally a fairly simple data structure, the display is orthogonal *but*
  #         there could well be some helper methods on nodes, for example, to
  #         - traverse the tree
  #         - generate the currently allowable keys etc. depending on the configuration
  #         - validate the configuration
  #         - generate the display data depending on the configuration (i.e. title, description,
  #           panels)
  #       - how to handle multi-select?
  #       - could this be built from shell (e.g. bash) completions, such that the user could
  #         navigate the available options for a command using this tool? (See fig completions,
  #         which are user-contributed and open source: https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete)
  #       - could this accept unstructured JSON data?
  #         - JSON is, after all, a fairly simple data format with a tree structure
  #         - could it be used to formulate a JSON query for later use? For example, the traversal
  #           information, e.g. the selected item in an array, the key of a given object, etc.,
  #           could be used to create the query. The output could be e.g. jq:
  #             '.a.b.[] | select(.id == "blah")'
  #           or some sort of traversal query native to this tool

  #       - show some sort of preview pane for the current selection? E.g. if creating a systemd
  #         manager, it would be useful to show the currently selected service in a preview pane,
  #         even before selecting the action we'd like to take with it.

  # TODO: Always show working directory in shell prompt, but truncate if it's too long, rather than
  #       not showing at all. Or perhaps break the line? Or show it on its own line? Could check
  #       out powerline for zsh.
  # TODO: my current vim markdown config kinda sucks. Biggest current objection, when wrapping
  #       lines in a list, it will create a new list item. Can this be avoided? Check
  #       `vim-markdown` plugin- is it just syntax highlighting? Is there something else? Turns out
  #       I write a fair bit of markdown.
  # TODO: spotifyfs. A... wait.. it might already exist! A FUSE interface for Spotify:
  #       https://github.com/catharsis/spotifile
  # TODO: a kubernetes port-forwarder that creates some sort of local shell that controls name
  #       resolution within it. Something like kubefwd that lets you access your k8s services by
  #       their service names, but works without modifying your local /etc/hosts, and allows you to
  #       access your local files without a docker mount or similar.
  #       One idea might be to start a shell within a network namespace where DNS resolution is
  #       controlled to resolve port-forwards, so something like `ip netns exec vnet0 $SHELL` or `ip
  #       netns exec vnet0 su - msk`. E.g.:
  #       - https://serverfault.com/questions/925334/setting-a-custom-etc-hosts-or-resolver-for-one-process-only-in-linux
  #       It might also be possible to use cgroups to achieve this. Some more inspiration:

  # TODO: Map keyboard setup to kmonad so other keyboards are a bit less alien. Consider also using
  #       kmonad with keyboard.
  # TODO: kmonad to make keyboard behave the same regardless of machine. I.e. holding z is ctrl.
  # TODO: Tool that just takes k8s manifests, or a k8s manifest list, applies them to the cluster,
  #       and waits until all deployments are ready. This is because kubectl wait is distinct from
  #       kubectl apply, and there is no easy way to wait for everything _that you just applied_.
  #       Perhaps the tool I really want is one that applies, waits for everything that's just been
  #       deployed, and optionally prunes anything that no longer needs to exist. It could perhaps
  #       track resources it "owns" and prune only those. And nothing more.
  # TODO: hotkey to toggle mirrored xmonad layout
  # TODO: libjq? Or a translation layer between lenses and jq? I.e. "traversal systems" as per the
  #       blog post. Then no need for a libjq for languages that have a traversal system; and
  #       either syntax (and potentially other syntaxes; i.e. jsonpath) can be valid for traversal.
  # TODO: Structured editor with which you insert language primitives. I.e. c-b would insert a
  #       block statement (complete with curly braces). C-a would insert an assignment. This could
  #       be simulated with UltiSnips... In fact, it might not need any more than UltiSnips. But
  #       later, it might be desirable for the editor to have text objects that are parts of the
  #       language structure. This might already exist with vim tree sitter implementation. We
  #       might be able to modify hop.nvim to integrate with tree sitter and jump straight to a
  #       (leaf?) node. And similarly with text objects: "change within this node", "comment this
  #       node". Cool... look deeper.
  # TODO: vim: hop/easymotion to textobject; specifically, treesitter text objects; so, jump to
  #       program symbol, i.e. variables, keywords, etc;
  # TODO: Cursor jump to monitor/window
  # TODO: "Toggle to last workspace" XMonad. Like <c-^> in Vim.

  # TODO: consider making many of my services (e.g. Firefox) wait for
  #       `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` as well as `graphical-session-pre.target`.
  # TODO: spell-check in vim; especially for markdown. I wonder if it's possible to spell-check
  #       word boundaries in code. I.e. camelCase or kebab-case etc. Also markdown etc.
  # TODO: make dotfiles literate?
  # TODO: eliminate all shitty web apps, including "chromium apps" by using native calendar, email,
  #       notes clients etc. And perhaps matrix bridge to any messaging services.
  # TODO: single-tab (or untabbed) browser instance with no user data directory for use as
  #       $BROWSER ? Can we bundle webextensions? Perhaps with no user chrome or something?
  # TODO: Per-directory commands and discovery. For example, "build" could be a command for a
  #       project directory. Moreover, "build" could take parameters, such as --debug, or
  #       --release. But how do I know when commands are available, what they are, and what
  #       parameters are available? Availability of commands could perhaps be displayed in my shell
  #       prompt, then a basic help command could display available commands and parameters. This
  #       might be largely achievable with direnv.
  # TODO: password generation with parameters- if this doesn't exist already, make it; TUI/GUI?
  # TODO: kmonad to make keyboard behave the same regardless of machine. I.e. holding z is ctrl.
