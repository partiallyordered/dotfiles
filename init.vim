" TODO:
"  - Language server client
"  - Is it possible to enter a mode that maps the home row to numbers as follows:
"    [a s d f g h j k l ;] -> [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0]
"    then a mode where these could be entered instead of numbers, which are easier to miss?
"    For example <leader>j would enter the mode, then 'as' would be equivalent to '10', such that
"    entering <leader>jasj would go down 10 lines, like 10j?
"    One problem would be that it wouldn't necessarily be easy to tell when number mode ended. An
"    end key or a fixed number of digits would be needed thus: <leader>j;sj (two digits two move
"    two lines) or <leader>jas<CR>j. The latter would defeat the purpose somewhat. So indeed might
"    the former- as being unusable in a subset of scenarios might diminish usefulness through
"    complexity in actual usage.
"  - Possible to display a solid bar at the wrap-around width to indicate visually when lines are
"    over that width?
"  - Often after an easymotion, it's desirable to enter insert mode immediately. Perhaps remap F to
"    do this? I.e. noremap F fXi (where X is the key in question)
"  - Show trailing tabs in the same manner as we show trailing spaces
"  - Using tcomment, take the <leader>tcy and add a number. E.g. <leader>tc4y to copy the current
"    line and the four following lines comment them, then paste.
"  - Set up ligatures for Haskell:
"    - http://www.bytesizedworkbench.com/blog/2017/10/24/the-joy-of-alacritty/<Paste>
"    - https://github.com/enomsg/vim-haskellConcealPlus
"  - Set up better documentation for Haskell
"  - Consider moving to spacemacs with Haskell layer for Haskell
"  - Set up a keybinding for visual mode to surround the current selection with a given
"    parenthesis. E.g., start with the selection: hello, end with the selection: (hello).
